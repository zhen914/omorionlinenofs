message_11:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Ahem...\! right.\! Now where should I start?

message_12:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>In the beginning was me...\! crying in a pod in the middle of space...\! witnessing my home planet blow up right before my eyes.

message_13:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>I can still remember it all so vividly...\!<br>Fire...\| Fire...\| everywhere...\| and then darkness.

message_14:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>When I awoke, I found myself in the middle of a desert...\! surrounded by a sea of brown sugar, in a strange land I soon learned to be called \c[11]ORANGE OASIS\c[0].

message_15:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Even as a baby, I knew I was the sole survivor of my species...\! the last elf in the entire universe.

#*Party members gather and sit*

message_16:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>\"So this is how it ends..."\ I thought.

message_17:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>Yet...\! In a stroke of luck, I was found by none other than a young \c[3]DONUT\c[0] by the name of SWEETHEART.\! She brought me to her family and they took me in as one of their own.

message_18:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>SWEETHEART and I...\! We grew up together.

message_19:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>It was a rough childhood.\! We fought frequently, but she would always win...\! If I fought back...\! Well...\! ...

message_20:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Anyway! I learned to run!\! And I got quite good at running...\!<br>But...\! there's only so far you can run.

message_21:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Yes, it was a hard time.\! But even through that suffering, I stood firm.


message_22:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>Because even then, I knew everything had a purpose.\! I was sent to this planet and survived for one reason and one reason only...\! to repopulate my entire species.

#*pause*

message_23:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>There is a conspicuous gap in my memory after this, so I'll fast-forward a few years.

message_24:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>At some point...\! SWEETHEART and I fell deeply in love, became engaged, and moved to this giant castle together!

message_25:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>We were inseparable, her and I... and we loved each other dearly!\! I would do anything for her, and I mean anything!

message_26:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>I was ready to spend the rest of our lives together...\! to grow old...\! and to raise hundreds upon hundreds of children!

message_27:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>Hmm... Thinking about it now, I wonder if I ever made that clear to her.

message_28:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Anyway, continuing my story...

message_29:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Alas, all good times must come to an end.\! As SWEETHEART's fan base grew, she and I grew apart as well.

message_30:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>She began receiving gifts and letters from suitors from all over the universe...\! asking for a chance to prove their love to her.


message_31:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Being her one true love, I was vehemently against this notion! But she wouldn't have it!

message_32:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>“SWEETHEART is for sharing!” she would say!

message_33:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>...

message_34:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>So...\! one night while I was asleep...\! SWEETHEART and her servants tied me up and sealed me inside the walls of her castle.

message_35:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>I have been wandering aimlessly through the darkness inside the walls ever since...\! surviving off old TOAST and \c[3]TOFU\c[0].


message_37:
      text: \n<ROCOCO>Fast-forward a few more years, and that brings us to now!

message_38:
    text: \n<ROCOCO>Yes...\! You four are the first living beings I have seen since that fateful day.
