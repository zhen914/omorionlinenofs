#BLACK SPACE

#Gameplay:

#In Black Space Entrance, there will be many black doors and no footprints.
#Instead, going through any black door in Black Space Entrance will teleport the player to the same Required Room.

#There are 6 Required Rooms before you enter the room with BASIL.
#The player will be teleported to them chronologically from 1-6 each time they enter a black door. In the true route, the basil deaths will happen the same way.

#Once the PLAYER enters a Required Room, the door back should disappear, forcing the Player to leave by coming in contact with a RED HAND or using STAB, which teleports OMORI back to the blanket in Black Space Entrance.

#There should be one or more RED HANDS placed in each area.

#Essentially, the PLAYER isn't required to go through the contents of the Required Rooms to progress the game if they STAB themselves as soon as they enter, which is fine.

#Inside the required rooms will be hidden ways to discover other parts of Black Space (the parts we have previously created). I will create a guide on how to split up those areas and input them later.

#TRUE ROUTE - RED SPACE:

#BGM: bs_listening.ogg

#When you STAB or use RED HAND, you enter a map with the hands parallax.

#At the end of the map is BASIL, who is being held by the RED HANDS.

#There are drag marks on the floor (same one as from the lamp room).

#OMORI stabs BASIL (no PLAYER control)

#BASIL falls to the floor. (Maybe BGM doesn't stop)

#*OMORI steps over BASIL and walks up the staircase.

#*The RED hands form the way up and OMORI takes his throne.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#NEUTRAL ROUTE - THE FIRST BASIL + SOMETHING CHASE:

#After grabbing Basil, it will say:


message_410:
      text: BASIL joined the party.

#(During this time, switch the church map to an alternate longer map)

#The camera pans up back to the Something shape.
#Something shows its eyes and mouth and begins to chase OMORI and BASIL.

#Start playing BGM: bs_loop5.ogg


#At the bottom of the map is Player's Something, which blocks your way no matter where you go (like SNALEY). So you have no choice but to run into him.

#PLAYER (not OMORI) is in a room with just SOMETHING in the spotlight.
#PLAYER walks up to SOMETHING and examines it to start the fight.

#During the Something fight, Player's skills are taken away one by one. Player is defeated by Something and is taken to the game over screen.
#When on the game over screen, select “Retry” to come back as OMORI instead of PLAYER.

#OMORI fights SOMETHING and defeats it.
#Note: OMORI should learn a special skill that utilizes RED HANDS

#When Something is defeated, OMORI wakes up.

#OMORI wakes up and looks up.

#The RED HANDS form a staircase.

#The staircase goes into a white light, then PLAYER and BASIL come out through a few different maps with different parallaxes (music changes every time), then lastly a space parallax. Should feel very magical.

#At the end of the RED HANDS staircase in the space parallax map is NEIGHBOR'S BEDROOM map.

#SLEEPYTIME:
#Map: Neighbor's Bedroom
#Activation: Exit Black Space after saving Basil

#BGM: playing_forever.ogg

#In this map, there are 6 beds.
#MARI, HERO, KEL, and AUBREY are already sleeping in theirs.

#You look at the RED HANDS. The RED HANDS will leave, so there will no longer be a staircase down.

#BASIL will look at you and then walk to his bed and go to sleep.

#When you go to sleep, you wake up in FA.

#*One day left... Slide shows*

#NEUTRAL ROUTE - DAYTIME HALLUCINATIONS
#*Player wakes up & plays cleaning mini-game sorting boxes with Something watching over him all day*

#There should be various spooks around the house that puts the player at unease.
#Something's appear in the “black area” around the interior maps.

#*After cleaning, player goes to sleep.

#*Omori saves Player animation plays.

#*Then slides: Welcome to White Space.
#*You have been here for as long as you can remember.

#*The laptop is still working like the first time you go there (before black letters)

#*You can enter through the white door and go to Neighbor's Room.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#BASIL'S MEMORIES:

#*After being caught by the spotlights, PLAYER has a falling animation before he arrives into Red Room.

#*Make it mandatory to have the photos sorted in the book during basil's memories. Sorting album pops up every time you get a photo.

#when you screw in the light bulb, have a slide of the lightbulb flickering, and then turning on (white_lightbulb[3x1].png)

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#CROSSROADS:

#*Make sure you can access FA album with [Q] and BS album with [W]

#*Streetlights with memories should be timed so that they light up as PLAYER is running. PLAYER shouldn't have to walk back to “catch” the spotlight.
